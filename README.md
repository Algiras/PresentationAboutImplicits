# Presentation about implicit induction

This is a repository with sample code for Fp Meetup in Vilnius Lithuania.

In the talk I will discuss methods of scrapping your boilerplate
by using implicit induction and scala's type system. As part of the demo, 
I will talk about `HList` and problems it helps us solve.  

The reading order is:

1. [Basics](src/main/scala/Presentation/Basics.sc) - examples of induction in programming
2. [Tuple](src/main/scala/Presentation/Tuple.sc) - examples of induction using simple data structures
3. [Shape](src/main/scala/Presentation/Shape.sc) - using Shapeless to level up the implementation
